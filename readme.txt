# English to Hinglish Translator

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure to change the `username` and `API key` in the setup. Replace `'----'` with your Kaggle account details.

   ```python
   !echo '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME","key":"YOUR_API_KEY"}' >> kaggle.json
   ```

2. Run the setup on a Colab notebook.

## Usage
- We provide a function called `predict_by_model()` that allows you to pass an English message for translation.

## Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words
- If you encounter blank outputs, it indicates that the model doesn't have certain words in its corpus. This can be improved by expanding the training data with a larger corpus.

## Output
We have created an `output.csv` file that includes the following columns:
- `en_query`: English text
- `cs_query`: Hinglish text
- `gen_query`: Text generated by our model

## Note
- For optimal performance, training the model with a larger dataset is recommended. However, our model was trained on a subset of 50,000 data samples.

Enjoy translating English to Hinglish with our deep learning-based translator!

The program is a key component of a sequence-to-sequence model employing an encoder-decoder architecture, a fundamental approach often employed in machine translation and various natural language processing tasks. Let's delve into the program's core components:



Data Generator (generate_batch):

This function serves the crucial role of generating data batches for training the sequence-to-sequence model.
 It accepts both input data (X) and target data (y) and produces data batches with a specified batch size. 
Each batch is composed of three primary NumPy arrays: encoder input, decoder input, and decoder target data. 
It tokenizes the input and target text for each sample within the batch, populating the encoder input array with token indices for 
input words, the decoder input array with token indices for target words, and the decoder target data array with one-hot encoded target tokens,
excluding the special "START_" token.

Encoder Part:

The encoder portion of the model is tasked with encoding the input sequence. 
It accepts the input sequence and employs an embedding layer to transform word indices into continuous vector representations. 
Subsequently, the LSTM layer processes these embeddings, culminating in the generation of encoder states, which include both hidden and cell states. 
These encoder states are crucial as they play a pivotal role in initializing the decoder part.

Decoder Part:

In contrast, the decoder component is responsible for processing the target sequence. 
It, too, leverages an embedding layer to convert target word indices into continuous vector representations. 
The LSTM layer within the decoder takes on the role of processing these embeddings and yields sequences of outputs. 
Finally, a dense layer takes these outputs and transforms them into a probability distribution over target words.

Model Definition:

To unify and define the entire sequence-to-sequence model, the Model class is used. It accepts both encoder and decoder 
inputs and subsequently generates decoder outputs. The encoder states serve as the vital initial state for the decoder LSTM. 
This model is specifically designed for training purposes.

Overall, this code represents a standard implementation of a sequence-to-sequence model, often enriched with an attention mechanism. 
Such models find utility in various language-related tasks, including but not limited to neural machine translation and text summarization, 
demonstrating their versatility and importance in the realm of natural language processing.
